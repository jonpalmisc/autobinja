# Autobinja

Autobinja is a harness for automated headless analysis & patching with Binary
Ninja.

*NOTE: Autobinja is an experimental project with a feature set defined almost
solely by the needs of its author. It is open source in the hope that it may be
useful to others, but should not be treated as stable or used in production.*

## Installation

Clone the repository, then install by running `pip install .`.

You may also choose to manually add Autobinja to your `PATH` or run it directly;
it does not have to be installed through Pip to work.

## Usage
